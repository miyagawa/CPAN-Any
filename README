NAME
    CPAN::Any - Install Perl modules using any of CPAN clients

SYNOPSIS
      use CPAN::Any;

      # install modules using the user's favorite installer
      CPAN::Any->install_module("Plack");

      # explicitly specify which client to use
      my $cpan = CPAN::Any->new("cpanm");
      $cpan->install_module("Catalyst");

DESCRIPTION
    CPAN::Any is an interface to install Perl modules using any CPAN client.

WHY
    There are many tools and modules that use (one of) CPAN clients to
    install modules, and most of them hardcode the author's favorite CPAN
    clients, either CPAN, CPANPLUS or cpanm. Examples are Dist::Zilla,
    App::CPAN::Fresh, Acme::Everything, Module::AutoINC and CPAN::AutoINC,
    but could be more.

    CPAN::Any provides one unified interface to install modules, and which
    client to use is now up to user's own configuration.

METHODS
    install_module
          CPAN::Any->install_module($package [, ... ]);

        Install the module using its package name. Calling this method as a
        class method is equivalent to:

          my $client = CPAN::Any->auto;
          $client->install_module($package);

PREFERENCE
    "CPAN::Any->install_module($module)" and friends will automatically
    detect which client to use, based on the following order.

    PERL_PREFER_CPAN_CLIENT
        Users can set the environment variable "PERL_PREFER_CPAN_CLIENT" to
        the acceptable client name. Acceptable values are "CPAN", "CPANP",
        "CPANPLUS", "cpanm" and "cpanminus". The values are case insensitive
        for convenience.

    CPAN::Any::Config
        When this module (CPAN::Any) is installed from CPAN, CPANPLUS or
        cpanm it automatically sets up the current installer you use as the
        preferred installer type in CPAN::Any::Config module and installs it
        in your site include path.

        You can reinstall modules using one of those installers to change
        the default preference.

    fallback to CPAN
        If none of the above is set, the default installer is CPAN.
